# Search Data
The ESS-DIVE Dataset API enables programmatic search of dataset metadata and access to their contents. The ESS-DIVE Deep Dive API enables direct search within data files across datasets that are following certain standards.

### Using Data with the Dataset and Deep Dive API (Python)
This Jupyter Notebook tutorial illustrates a data discovery workflow and approaches to searching for and exploring inside datasets using both the Dataset API and Deep Dive API. The example provided plots two data files in different datasets that have matching search terms and download both the files and dataset citations.

### Finding Accessing Data (Python): Approaches to Inspecting Datasets via the ESS-DIVE Dataset API
This Jupyter Notebook tutorial illustrates a general dataset search and approaches for inspecting dataset contents with and without FLMD and Data Dictionary files (ESS-DIVE Community File-level Metadata Reporting Format). It also illustrates inspection of datasets employing the ESS-DIVE Community Sample ID and Metadata Reporting Format.

Code to import csv files to Pandas dataframes and download data files to local storage are also included.
