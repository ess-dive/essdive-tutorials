    "This notebook includes steps to submit data to ESS-DIVE through the API. This is a tutorial notebook and contains extra guidance and information about the API and metadata creation process. \n",
    "\n",
    "The ESS-DIVE Dataset API is a service that enables projects to programmatically submit and manage datasets with ESS-DIVE. This is an alternative to using the ESS-DIVE Online form for data uploads. This service encodes metadata using the JSON-LD specification. JSON-LD is a schema to encode linked Data using JSON, and in the future will be used by Google to index metadata for searches. The use of the standardized JSON-LD schema will dramatically increase the visibility of datasets, and also enable projects to create one-time code that can be reused for periodic uploads of datasets to ESS-DIVE. \n",

The S1 bog was harvested in successive strip cuts in 1969 and 1974 and the cut areas were allowed to naturally regenerate.

The area was suitable for siting a monitoring station for representative meteorological conditions on the S1 bog.
