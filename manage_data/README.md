# Manage Data


### Project Dataset Metric Report - Python
This Jupyter Notebook will export a list of metrics for datasets published under your chosen project. At the end of this notebook you will have a report of:
- Total number of *public project datasets
- Download and view counts per public dataset
- FAIR Assessment report results
- Summary of assessment report checks that have failed to identify areas of improvement

_*If you access to private datasets:_ This report would include private dataset counts as well (download/view only available for published data)

### Share Datasets (Python): Lookup and Change Dataset Permissions
The ESS-DIVE Dataset API enables data contributors to programmatically review who currently has access to view, edit, or
manage their dataset, as well as, add or remove individuals from their dataset permissions. 

This Jupyter Notebook tutorial provides a basic example of how to execute the API's sharing operations for one dataset.
The example code could readily be expanded to manage dataset permissions in bulk.
